Files in this directory are the RTL Verlog code for the HMC MIPS processor

components.v:  Small modules and spare parts
imem.v: simulated external memory with test vector loading
mem.v: cache and memory system
mipspipelined.v:  MIPS processor (not including cache/memory and mult/div unit)
multdiv.v: Multiplier and divider unit
top.v:  Top-level verilog code for entire MIPS processor + testbench


Note: need mipstest.v from testbenches too
